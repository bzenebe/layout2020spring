  <p>I initially sketched out two versions of my portfolio with different header arrangements. I first explored a typical header navigation that would be below my name logo (serving as HOME navigation). I realized this arrangement is not ideal because it can mask some images below it, and doesn't engage a visitor to look thoroughly through my portfolio. </p>

  <p>I decided to use a side menu because it separates the navigation from the space that is the container for my work. I will make a 3 different general pages for my work: image-heavy pages, text inclusive pages, and other general body (shop, contact page). I have adjusted the overall design to account for these changes in design that would distinguish them and their purposes: to showcase, to explain, and to shop/contact. 
</p>
<p>
  A user would first land on a splash page that indicates the vibe of my website, priming them for the experience. The splash page consists of my name as a vector image in the center of the page, and some hover objects around my name. "Something Special" is my capstone project, explore will bring someone to my entire mixed work page, and sketchbook would bring someone to my sketchbook pages. All of these navigations will bring someone to a page that has the nav menu included. There will exist pages for my entire body of work, for illustration only, design only, interaction only, and magazine work. There will also be an about me page, I will attempt to set up a makeshift shop, and I will also have a page to submit a form (contact) and a page linking to my capstone project (besides the splash page.) Each project will also have its own page. 
</p>
<p>
  I will employ flexbox to fit the images into the container for images and I will be using fixed and relative positioning to juxtapose image and text.
