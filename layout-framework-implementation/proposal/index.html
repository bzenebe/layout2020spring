<h1>
	Proposal for Portfolio Site
</h1>

<p>I have proposed a website to showcase my portolio and serve as a way to complete this class and prepare for future employment. My website will captivate my audience with a splash page. It will then bring a visitor to a page viewing of all my work, from which they can navigate between my illustrations, design work, and web development work. In addition, I would like to a page contributed to my senior capstone project, and am considering an online shop (just for temporary filler space). The content involved is all mine so I have complete authority over how I can present the images and text. </p>

<h1>Proposed Framework</h1>

<p> <b>Foundation. </b>Although I wanted to learn the basics of bootstrap, I feel I can manage to learn and work with foundation because it offers more customizeability (I don't think this is a word).
