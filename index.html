  <p>I sketched out two versions of my portfolio with different header arrangements. I first explored a typical header navigation that would be below my name logo (serving as HOME navigation). I realized this arrangement is not ideal because it can mask some images below it, and doesn't engage a visitor to look thoroughly through my portfolio. 

  I looked into a side menu because it separates the navigation from the space that is the container for my work. I decided to make a 3 different general pages for my work: Image heavy pages, text inclusive pages, and other (shop, contact page). I have adjusted the overall design to account for these changes in design that would distinguish them and their purposes: to showcase, to explain, and to (shop, contact, etc). </p>
